# Kiro vs. Cursor

[Cursor](https://cursor.com) is an AI-powered code editor developed by [Anysphere](https://anysphere.inc/). [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) is an AI IDE developed by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). Both tools aim to enhance developer productivity. Both tools are forks of Visual Studio Code and integrate advanced AI capabilities directly into the IDE.

## Summary

Both Kiro and Cursor are AI-powered IDEs that enhance developer productivity, but they take different approaches to AI-assisted programming. Here are the key differences:

**Kiro's Unique Advantages:**
- **Spec-driven development**: Structured approach to complex development tasks that formalizes the software development process - this is unique to Kiro
- **Agent Hooks**: Automated triggers that execute predefined agent actions when specific events occur in the IDE
- **Flexible Autonomy**: Both Autopilot mode (autonomous end-to-end task completion) and Supervised mode (human review before applying changes)

**Cursor's Unique Advantages:**
- **More Model Choices**: Supports multiple providers (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, xAI) with automatic selection capabilities
- **Predict Next Edit**: Tab-tab functionality that predicts your next edit based on recent changes
- **Memories & Checkpoints**: Automatically generated rules based on conversations that maintain context across sessions; automatic snapshots of agent changes for easy rollback
