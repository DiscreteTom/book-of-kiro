## What is Kiro?

Kiro is an AI IDE designed for developers who want more than just code completion. It's built around the philosophy that great software starts with clear specifications and structured thinking. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants, Kiro offers:

- **Spec-driven Development**: Turn requirements into structured specifications before implementation
- **Agent Hooks**: Automate workflows with custom triggers and actions
- **Contextual Understanding**: With specs, steering, and smart context management, Kiro understands the intent behind your prompts and helps you implement complex features on larger codebases, in fewer shots.
- **Autonomous Agent Modes**: Choose between Supervised and Autopilot modes for different levels of control
- **Integrate tools and data with MCP**: Connect to docs, databases, APIs, and more with native MCP integration so you can bring your world where you work.
