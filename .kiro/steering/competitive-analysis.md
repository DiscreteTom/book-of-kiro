# Competitive Analysis Standards

## Table Structure Guidelines

When creating competitive analysis content, follow these standardized table formats and conventions to ensure consistency across all comparison pages.

### Standard Table Format

Use this exact table structure for all competitive comparisons:

```markdown
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>类别</th>
<th>功能</th>
<th>描述</th>
<th>Kiro</th>
<th>[Competitor Name]</th>
<th>备注</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<!-- Content rows here -->
</tbody>
</table>
```

### Status Indicators

Use consistent symbols:
- ✅ for supported features
- ❌ for unsupported features
- Specific details in parentheses when needed

### Required Elements

Every competitive analysis page must include:

1. **Comparison Date Hint Box**:
```markdown
{{% hint info %}}
**最后对比日期**：[YYYY年MM月DD日]
{{% /hint %}}
```

2. **Summary Section**: Brief overview highlighting key differentiators

3. **Feature Comparison Table**: Using the standard format above


### Comments Column Guidelines

The "备注" (Comments) column should provide:
- Strategic insights about feature importance
- Context about limitations or advantages
- Clarification of technical details
- Cultural or market-specific considerations for Chinese audience


### Content Quality Standards

- **Factual Accuracy**: Verify all feature claims and pricing information
- **Fair Comparison**: Present balanced view
- **Technical Precision**: Use specific technical terms and accurate descriptions
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Adapt content for Chinese developer audience
- **Regular Updates**: Include comparison dates and update regularly

This standardized approach ensures all competitive analysis content maintains consistency, accuracy, and strategic value while effectively communicating Kiro's advantages to the target audience.
